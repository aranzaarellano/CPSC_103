    "This is a quick guide to Jupyter and an introduction to Python. We expect that this may be your first exposure to working with a programming language. Don't worry if there are parts of this tutorial that don't make sense to you.  Programming is a skill that is possibly different from anything you've done before, so give yourself some time to get comfortable with it! And, ask for help and thoughts from the course staff: in person in lecture or tutorial and online on our discussion board!"
